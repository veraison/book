# Attestation Schemes

An attestation scheme describes how an attestation should be verified.
Specifically, it defines

- The structure of attestation evidence submitted for verification
- The endorsements and trust anchors needed
- How all of the above is evaluated to produce an [attestation
  result](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-fv-rats-ear/)

Veraison supports different attestation schemes via plugins.
