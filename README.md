This is the source repo for the Veraison book hosted at

[http://www.veraison-project.org/book/](http://www.veraison-project.org/book/)

To build it locally, first make sure you have all the dependencies:

```bash
make bootstrap
```

(this only needs to be done once). And then

```bash
make book
```

When making changes, you can host a version locally that gets updated in real
time with

```bash
make serve
```
